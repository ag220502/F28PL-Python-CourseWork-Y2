Jamie's bad-tempered answers to students' questions:


Q. My code is correct but doesn't pass the test because I use a different data structure / print to terminal instead of return / something else.  What should I do?

A. Code that does not pass the tests is by definition not correct code.  
Code that does pass the tests is not necessarily correct; it's just not incorrect according to the tests.  Write more tests; you're not testing something unless you're really try to break it. 
 

Q. Is it assumed that values passed into the functions cadd() and cmult() will follow the format (x,y) where both x and y are integers, e.g.: (1,1),  and not something like (1,4j) or (2,5i)

A. Yes.  That's what the question says:

   For instance,
    cadd((1,0),(0,1))
   should compute
    (1,1).


Q. 1A and 1B - it is assumed that the functions are meant to return a value in addition to also computing the value, is this true?

A. You're confusing "printing to terminal" with computation.  Returning a value is done via `return`; printing to terminal is done using `print`.  Computation happens throughout the program.
